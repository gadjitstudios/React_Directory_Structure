    <dt>Introduction</dt>
    <dd>
        React is an very unopinionated language, which is great because it allows the developer(s) to create a
        structure/style of coding that meets the needs of the project as opposed to a list of rules thought up by the
        language's creators. There are some downsides to this, especially when you are beginning to learn the language.
        One of the issues I had with my first React project was with the layout of my project's directory structure.
        There are some resources out there to help you figure out somewhat of a basic structure; such as this article
        from React's website:&nbsp; https<a
            href="https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html">://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html</a>; but, if you
        dig any deeper you are likely to find some conflicting opinions.&nbsp;
        <br />
        There is one other important concept we must talk about before we get into the thick of it, and that is the idea
        of single responsibility. Basically what this states is that a module must only be responsible for doing one
        thing. We will add to this discussion on single responsibility when we start talking about the individual
        directories; and what better time to do that then now. So<span style="letter-spacing: 0.2px;">, having said
            that, I thought that I would throw my hat into the ring, and give you my opinion on a directory structure.
            Here it is:</span>
        <br />
        <br />
    </dd>
    <dt>Components</dt>
    <dd>I like to think of components as the "micro" level of React. These are small, reusable components such a custom
        buttons, picture galleries, etc. The best way to figure out whether you're module should go in this directory is
        to ask, "will I be able to rip this code out of this project and place it in a different one, and NOT require
        any other modules (3rd party, such as Redux or Bootstrap, excluded)?" If the answer is yes, you are allowed to
        add your module to the components directory. There are two more rules of the components directory that you must
        follow:&nbsp;
        <ul>
            <li>each component must have its own directory inside of the components directory</li>
            <li>each component directory inside of the components directory must contain only that components source
                files</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>Views</dt>
    <dd>Views are made up of a collection of components from the component directory, and/or individual html elements. A
        view's single responsibility is to display elements or components to the user. In doing this, a view will
        collect data from other modules and use that data to produce the view. Remember, view only gathers this
        information, it does nothing to produce it.&nbsp;</dd>
    <br />
    <dt>Services</dt>
    <dd>A service is a module that is used to provide,&nbsp;validate, or manipulate data for use in another module. The
        most common service I create in my React apps is an API service, who's single responsibility is to make REST
        calls to servers (typically the app's backend). I have, in the past, also created a service to validate form
        data using Regex checks. These are just some examples of what you might find in the services directory.
    </dd>
    <br />
    <dt>Assets</dt>
    <dd>This is a pretty common naming convention/ style. Typically the Assets directory contains image, logos, and
        other resources used throughout the app. The Assets directory should contain other directories that will
        organize these resources accordingly. Please do yourself a favor and do not just pile all of your resources
        directly in the Assets directory. Also, remember that a view is responsible for collecting an assembling what
        the user sees, so it is most likely that a majority of your resources will be imported in a view an passed to
        other components.
    </dd>
    <br />
    <dt>Stores</dt>
    <dd>This directory is optional, and should only contain state store modules, such as a Redux store, a custom "use"
        hook, etc. Basically, if it acts like a store, it goes here.</dd>
    <br />
    <dt>Common File Types</dt>
    <dd>Now that we have our directories defined, we need to talk a little bit about the files you will find inside of a
        directory, specifically the views and components directories. There are 3 common file types that these
        directories should contain:
        <ol>
            <li>a React file (js or jsx)</li>
            <li>a style file (css, sass, scss)</li>
            <li>a data file (js, json, etc)</li>
        </ol>
        The first 2 are pretty self-explainitory, React files create React components (an import the other 2 file
        types); and, the style file adds css to the React component. The last file, a data file, is one that we have not
        really explored yet. This file's single responsibility is to collect data and supply that data to the React
        component. This file should also handle cleaning and storing that data.
        <br />
    </dd>
    <br />
    <dt>Example</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Just a note, the following example will use this git repo, <a
                href="https://github.com/gadjitstudios/React_App_From_Scratch">https://github.com/gadjitstudios/React_App_From_Scratch</a>,
            as a base. So, if you are following along, please go download/clone that repo and follow these directions:

        <h3>What We Will Be Creating</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>a simple view</li>
            <li>an image gallery component that retrieves images from the <a>assets</a> directory</li>
            <li>an <a>api</a> service that will use the fetch api to get infromation from the National Weather Service
                (I will be creating a blog post about this, stay tuned)</li>
        </ul>
        So, let's start out by creating the directories we mentioned in the descriptions above, like so:
        <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a
                href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i221MII1Y-U/X8p0jVT75WI/AAAAAAAAAH8/U75ieBksKCcpXi2amgQ6_idfNDWoVOgbACLcBGAsYHQ/s543/Root%2BDir.png"
                style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="543"
                    data-original-width="307" height="640"
                    src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i221MII1Y-U/X8p0jVT75WI/AAAAAAAAAH8/U75ieBksKCcpXi2amgQ6_idfNDWoVOgbACLcBGAsYHQ/w362-h640/Root%2BDir.png"
                    width="362" /></a></div>
        Next, we will create our API Service. To do this, we will create an <a>api</a> directory within the
        <a>services</a> directory like so:
        <div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a
                href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-syj9jyYLYbA/X8qKILcA4xI/AAAAAAAAAIo/0XLijYOzg7wqo-CaJTV-HSX2FSMmO9TCgCLcBGAsYHQ/s222/API%2BService%2BDir.png"
                style="display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="117"
                    data-original-width="222" height="211"
                    src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-syj9jyYLYbA/X8qKILcA4xI/AAAAAAAAAIo/0XLijYOzg7wqo-CaJTV-HSX2FSMmO9TCgCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h211/API%2BService%2BDir.png"
                    width="400" /></a></div>
        After creating the <a>api</a> directory, create a file within it called <a>index.js</a>. This is a Webpack
        short-cut, which allows us to shorten our import Url. I will call this out when we reach that point.
        <div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a
                href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lXqyY9g9pkY/X8qVALIUSfI/AAAAAAAAAJg/AF6cvXORpvEl32iI4CyGuFAkN-uMaHcXACLcBGAsYHQ/s211/API%2BService%2BIndex%2Bjs.png"
                style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="400"
                    data-original-height="136" data-original-width="211"
                    src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lXqyY9g9pkY/X8qVALIUSfI/AAAAAAAAAJg/AF6cvXORpvEl32iI4CyGuFAkN-uMaHcXACLcBGAsYHQ/s400/API%2BService%2BIndex%2Bjs.png" /></a>
        </div>
        Inside of the <a>index.js</a> file add the following code:
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/gadjitstudios/a00f9f6e544d796f37c71dd37b0df4a0.js"></script>
        I won't be describing what is going on in this file (that will be a different blog post), just know that this
        file has created an <var>Api_Service</var> object that we can use by importing it into other modules
        (<var>Api_Service</var> is a variable name, and could be named whatever you want). I will call this out when we
        get to that step.
